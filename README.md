Since my Kanji knowledge is not the best, I usually found myself selecting the kanji, opening a new tab for Jisho.org and translate it there. 

I made this extension as a convenient tool. Nothing too surprising happening in here. Just opens a new tab with the translation of the selected word/kanji.
